Questions about this project:


-What are we doing?
something with a deck of cards
guessing the top card
seeing if that guess is right

-What does Round do?
it does a few things:
  1) initialized by the deck and an empty array of guesses
  2)records a guess and stores it in a variable and compares it versus the most recent card drawn
  3)can tell us how many correct guesses there are
  4) can tell us percent of guesses entered that are correct

-How are we referencing methods from other files? Maybe this will be more clear when we learn about scope
-Referencing is still hazy. Where are we referencing attributes, methods, and instances of a class?
